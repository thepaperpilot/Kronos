    "Time? I love time!",
    "I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating - and it gets everywhere",
    "Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity",
    "Oh, how the time has flown",
    "Time is an illusion",
    "Time does not pass, it continues",
    "This, too, shall pass",
    "The hourglass mesmerizes me",
    "Each grain split makes my measurements more precise"
